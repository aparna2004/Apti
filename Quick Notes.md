### 1. BASIC MATHEMATICS FOUNDATIONS

**1.1 Fractions, Decimals, Percentages:**  
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - Converting fractions to decimals and vice versa (e.g., 1/2 = 0.5, 3/4 = 0.75)  
  - Converting fractions/decimals to percentages (e.g., 1/4 = 0.25 = 25%)  
  - Percentage change, percentage increase/decrease

- **Must-Know Formulas:**  
  - Percentage increase: \((\frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Original}} \times 100\%)\)  
  - Percentage decrease: \((\frac{\text{Decrease}}{\text{Original}} \times 100\%)\)  

- **Example:**  
  If a number increases from 200 to 250, the percentage increase = \((50/200) \times 100\% = 25\%\).

**1.2 Ratios and Proportions:**  
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - Understanding ratios (e.g., a:b = 2:3 means for every 2 units of a, b has 3 units).  
  - Equivalent ratios (scaling up or down by multiplying/dividing).  
  - Proportionality: If \( \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \), then ad = bc.

- **Techniques:**  
  - Simplify ratios to their lowest terms.  
  - Use cross-multiplication in solving proportions.

- **Example:**  
  If 2:3 :: x:9, then \(2 \times 9 = 3 \times x \implies x = 6.\)

### 2. PROBABILITY BASICS

**2.1 Fundamentals of Probability:**  
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - Probability = \(\frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}\).  
  - Complementary events: \(P(A) + P(\overline{A}) = 1\).  
  - Independent events: \(P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)\) if A and B are independent.

- **Example:**  
  Rolling a fair die: Probability of getting a 3 = 1/6.

**2.2 Conditional Probability & Bayes’ Theorem:**  
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - Conditional Probability: \(P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\).  
  - Bayes’ Theorem: \(P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\).

- **Example (Bayes):**  
  Suppose 2% of the population has a disease. A test gives a positive result 95% of the time if you have the disease, and falsely positive 1% of the time if you don’t.  
  If you test positive, what is the probability you have the disease?  
  - \(P(D) = 0.02, P(\overline{D})=0.98\)  
  - \(P(Pos|D)=0.95\), \(P(Pos|\overline{D})=0.01\)  
  Using Bayes: \(P(D|Pos)=\frac{0.95 \times 0.02}{(0.95 \times 0.02)+(0.01 \times 0.98)}\).

### 3. LOGICAL REASONING & APPLIED ARITHMETIC

**3.1 Time and Work:**  
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - If a person can do a job in ‘x’ days, their work rate is \(\frac{1}{x}\) of the job per day.  
  - Combined rates: If A does \(\frac{1}{a}\) per day and B does \(\frac{1}{b}\) per day, together they do \(\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}\) per day.

- **Formula:**  
  If A alone can do the work in a days, B alone in b days, then together: Time to finish = \(\frac{ab}{a+b}\) days.

- **Example:**  
  A does a job in 6 days, B in 12 days. Together per day work = \(1/6+1/12=1/4.\) Total work done in 4 days.

**3.2 Allegation and Mixtures:**  
- **Concept:**  
  Used to find the ratio in which two or more ingredients at different costs or strengths are mixed to produce a mixture of a desired mean cost or strength.

- **Formula (Alligation Rule):**  
  \[
  \text{Ratio of mixing} = \frac{\text{Difference in cost of the second ingredient and mean}}{\text{Difference in cost of the first ingredient and mean}}
  \]

- **Example:**  
  Mix two types of rice at Rs.20/kg and Rs.30/kg to get a mixture worth Rs.25/kg. Ratio = \((30-25):(25-20)=5:5=1:1.\)

**3.3 Clock Problems:**  
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - A clock’s minute hand moves 360° in 60 min (6° per min).  
  - Hour hand moves 360° in 12 hours = 30° per hour = 0.5° per minute.
  - Relative speed between minute and hour hand is 5.5° per minute.

- **Finding Angle:**  
  Angle at h hours m minutes = |(30h + 0.5m) - (6m)| = |30h - 5.5m|.

- **Example:**  
  At 3:15, hour hand = 3×30 + 15×0.5 = 90 + 7.5 = 97.5°, minute hand = 15×6=90°, angle = 7.5°.

**3.4 Pipes and Cisterns (Water Cistern Problems):**  
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - Similar to time and work. If a pipe fills a tank in x hours, rate = 1/x tank per hour.  
  - For one filling and one emptying pipe, net rate = (fill rate - empty rate).

- **Example:**  
  Pipe A fills in 6 hrs (rate=1/6), Pipe B fills in 3 hrs (rate=1/3). Together: 1/6+1/3=1/2 tank per hour, so 2 hours total.

### 4. PATTERN RECOGNITION AND REASONING

**4.1 Verbal Relationships:**  
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - Identify synonyms, antonyms, analogies, and logical relationships between words.  
  - Analogies: A:B :: C:D means A is related to B in the same way C is related to D.

- **Techniques:**  
  - Understand common relationship types: function (pen:write), part-whole (wheel:car), cause-effect (fire:smoke).

**4.2 Non-Verbal Patterns & Counting:**  
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - Identify patterns in figures, shapes, and sequences.  
  - Counting geometric shapes (like how many triangles in a figure), completing a pattern or identifying next figure in a series.

- **Approach:**  
  - Look for changes in orientation, number of sides, shading, rotations, symmetry.

### 5. DATA INTERPRETATION

**5.1 Tabular Data & **5.2 Charts, Graphs, and Pictorial Representations:**  
- **Concepts:**  
  - Read data carefully from tables, bar charts, pie charts, line graphs.  
  - Convert data into fractions or percentages to make comparisons.
  - Identify trends, differences, and relationships within given data.

**5.3 Strategies:**  
  1. Identify what is being asked.  
  2. Extract necessary information precisely.  
  3. Do step-by-step calculations and avoid approximation errors unless directed.

- **Example:**  
  If a pie chart shows total sales of 360 units and a sector represents 90 units, that sector is \(\frac{90}{360}=25\%\) of the total.

### 6. FINANCE & COMMERCIAL MATHEMATICS

**6.1 Simple Interest (SI):**  
- **Formula:**  
  \( SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \)  
  Where P = Principal, R = Rate (%), T = Time (years).

- **Example:**  
  P=1000, R=10% per annum, T=2 years; SI= (1000×10×2)/100=200.

**6.2 Compound Interest (CI):**  
- **Formula:**  
  \( A = P (1+\frac{R}{100})^T \), CI = A - P.

- **Example:**  
  P=1000, R=10%, T=2; \( A=1000(1.1^2)=1000(1.21)=1210\), CI=210.

**6.3 Profit, Loss & Discount:**  
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - Profit/Loss = Selling Price (SP) - Cost Price (CP).  
  - Profit % = (Profit/CP)×100.  
  - Loss % = (Loss/CP)×100.  
  - Marked Price (MP), Discount, and relationship with SP.

- **Example:**  
  CP=100, SP=120 → Profit=20, Profit%=20%.  
  If MP=200, discount 20%, SP=200-(20% of 200)=200-40=160.

**6.4 Partnership:**  
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - If two partners invest amounts A and B for same time, profit is shared in ratio A:B.  
  - If time differs, then ratio = (A×time) : (B×time).

- **Example:**  
  A invests Rs.2000 for 6 months, B invests Rs.3000 for 4 months. Ratio = (2000×6):(3000×4)=12000:12000=1:1.

### 7. ENGLISH COMPREHENSION

**7.1 Reading Comprehension Techniques:**  
- Read the passage carefully, identify main idea, author’s tone, and logical flow.  
- Skim for keywords if pressed for time.  
- Answer factual questions by scanning text; interpretive questions by inferring tone and meaning.

**7.2 Vocabulary and Contextual Meaning:**  
- Focus on common words, synonyms, antonyms.  
- Determine meaning of unfamiliar words by context: read surrounding sentences, look for clues.

**7.3 Grammar and Sentence Structure:**  
- Basic grammar rules (subject-verb agreement, correct tense usage).  
- Identify the logical structure of a sentence and eliminate grammatical errors in sentence improvement questions.
