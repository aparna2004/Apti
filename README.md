## 1. BASIC MATHEMATICS FOUNDATIONS

### 1.1 Fractions, Decimals, Percentages

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Converting fractions to decimals and vice versa (e.g., 1/2 = 0.5, 3/4 = 0.75)
  - Converting fractions/decimals to percentages (e.g., 1/4 = 0.25 = 25%)
  - Percentage change, percentage increase/decrease

- **Must-Know Formulas:**
  - Percentage increase:
  - Percentage decrease:

- **Example:**
  - If a number increases from 200 to 250, the percentage increase = ?

### 1.2 Ratios and Proportions

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Understanding ratios (e.g., a:b = 2:3 means for every 2 units of a, b has 3 units).
  - Equivalent ratios (scaling up or down by multiplying/dividing).
  - Proportionality: If a/b = c/d, then ad = bc.

- **Techniques:**
  - Simplify ratios to their lowest terms.
  - Use cross-multiplication in solving proportions.

- **Example:**
  - If 2:3 :: x:9, then x = ?

## 2. PROBABILITY BASICS

### 2.1 Fundamentals of Probability

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes).
  - Complementary events: P(A') = 1 - P(A).
  - Independent events: If A and B are independent, then P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B).

- **Example:**
  - Rolling a fair die: Probability of getting a 3 = 1/6.

### 2.2 Conditional Probability & Bayes’ Theorem

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Conditional Probability: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).
  - Bayes’ Theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B).

- **Example (Bayes):**
  - Suppose 2% of the population has a disease. A test gives a positive result 95% of the time if you have the disease, and falsely positive 1% of the time if you don’t.
  - If you test positive, what is the probability you have the disease? Using Bayes: ?

## 3. LOGICAL REASONING & APPLIED ARITHMETIC

### 3.1 Time and Work

- **Key Concepts:**
  - If a person can do a job in ‘x’ days, their work rate is 1/x of the job per day.
  - Combined rates: If A does 1/a per day and B does 1/b per day, together they do (1/a + 1/b) per day.

- **Formula:**
  - If A alone can do the work in a days, B alone in b days, then together: Time to finish = (ab) / (a + b) days.

- **Example:**
  - A does a job in 6 days, B in 12 days. Together, their per day work = ?

### 3.2 Allegation and Mixtures

- **Concept:**
  - Used to find the ratio in which two or more ingredients at different costs or strengths are mixed to produce a mixture of a desired mean cost or strength.

- **Formula (Alligation Rule):**
  - If the mean cost is between two prices, the ratio is found by the difference of the prices.

- **Example:**
  - Mix two types of rice at Rs.20/kg and Rs.30/kg to get a mixture worth Rs.25/kg. Ratio = ?

### 3.3 Clock Problems

- **Key Concepts:**
  - A clock’s minute hand moves 360° in 60 min (6° per min).
  - Hour hand moves 360° in 12 hours = 30° per hour = 0.5° per minute.
  - Relative speed between minute and hour hand is 5.5° per minute.

- **Finding Angle:**
  - Angle at h hours m minutes = |(30h + 0.5m) - (6m)| = |30h - 5.5m|.

- **Example:**
  - At 3:15, hour hand = 97.5°, minute hand = 90°, angle = ?

### 3.4 Pipes and Cisterns

- **Key Concepts:**
  - If a pipe fills a tank in x hours, rate = 1/x tank per hour.
  - For one filling and one emptying pipe, net rate = (fill rate - empty rate).

- **Example:**
  - Pipe A fills in 6 hrs (rate=1/6), Pipe B fills in 3 hrs (rate=1/3). Together: ?

## 4. PATTERN RECOGNITION AND REASONING

### 4.1 Verbal Relationships

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Identify synonyms, antonyms, analogies, and logical relationships between words.
  - Analogies: A:B :: C:D means A is related to B in the same way C is related to D.

- **Techniques:**
  - Understand common relationship types: function (pen:write), part-whole (wheel:car), cause-effect (fire:smoke).

### 4.2 Non-Verbal Patterns & Counting

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Identify patterns in figures, shapes, and sequences.
  - Counting geometric shapes (like how many triangles in a figure), completing a pattern or identifying the next figure in a series.

- **Approach:**
  - Look for changes in orientation, number of sides, shading, rotations, symmetry.

## 5. DATA INTERPRETATION

### 5.1 Tabular Data

- **Concepts:**
  - Read data carefully from tables, bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs.
  - Convert data into fractions or percentages to make comparisons.
  - Identify trends, differences, and relationships within the given data.

### 5.2 Charts, Graphs, and Pictorial Representations

- **Concepts:**
  - Similar to tabular data; focus on extracting and interpreting information accurately.

### 5.3 Comprehensive Question Solving Strategies

1. Identify what is being asked.
2. Extract necessary information precisely.
3. Do step-by-step calculations and avoid approximation errors unless directed.

- **Example:**
  - If a pie chart shows total sales of 360 units and a sector represents 90 units, that sector is 90/360 = 1/4 of the total.

## 6. FINANCE & COMMERCIAL MATHEMATICS

### 6.1 Simple Interest (SI)

- **Formula:**
  - SI = (P × R × T) / 100, where P = Principal, R = Rate (%), T = Time (years).

- **Example:**
  - P=1000, R=10% per annum, T=2 years; SI = (1000 × 10 × 2) / 100 = 200.

### 6.2 Compound Interest (CI)

- **Formula:**
  - A = P(1 + R/100)^T, CI = A - P.

- **Example:**
  - P=1000, R=10%, T=2; A = 1000(1 + 0.1)^2 = 1210, CI = 210.

### 6.3 Profit, Loss & Discount

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Profit/Loss = Selling Price (SP) - Cost Price (CP).
  - Profit % = (Profit/CP) × 100.
  - Loss % = (Loss/CP) × 100.

- **Example:**
  - CP=100, SP=120 → Profit=20, Profit%=20%. If MP=200, discount 20%, SP = 200 - (20% of 200) = 160.

### 6.4 Partnership

- **Key Concepts:**
  - If two partners invest amounts A and B for the same time, profit is shared in ratio A:B.
  - If time differs, then ratio = (A × time) : (B × time).

- **Example:**
  - A invests Rs.2000 for 6 months, B invests Rs.3000 for 4 months. Ratio = (2000 × 6):(3000 × 4) = 12000:12000 = 1:1.

## 7. ENGLISH COMPREHENSION

### 7.1 Reading Comprehension Techniques

- Read the passage carefully, identify the main idea, author’s tone, and logical flow.
- Skim for keywords if pressed for time.
- Answer factual questions by scanning text; interpretive questions by inferring tone and meaning.

### 7.2 Vocabulary and Contextual Meaning

- Focus on common words, synonyms, antonyms.
- Determine the meaning of unfamiliar words by context: read surrounding sentences, look for clues.

### 7.3 Grammar and Sentence Structure

- Basic grammar rules (subject-verb agreement, correct tense usage).
- Identify the logical structure of a sentence and eliminate grammatical errors in sentence improvement questions.
